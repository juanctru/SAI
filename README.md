RaspBerry Pi home automation project

There are another projects for home automation using the RaspBerry Pi all over the internet but I want to start my own from the background.
This project is wrote in python.

The purposes of this project are many, one of them is to get more experience about coding and sharing and to build a core home automation system useful with another AI systems like Siri or Alexa, so the RaspBerry can be use as the physical controller for many home devices that are not "intelligents". I know there are many devices right now but there are others that are not and for many of them it is cheaper to have just a RaspBerry controlling some standard devices that buy those new ones.
